#     Engage me was a week long final project at <a href='devbootcamp.com'>DevBootcamp</a>. With the help of the Microsoft Cognitive Services API, my team was able to display people's emotions in real time, giving the presenter an overview of how they are doing in real time, as well as the ability to look at the audience's emotion-data after the presentation to see shifts in emotions over time.

#     This mini-project was a rehearsal of working directly with a client with a pressing deadline. We designed, published, and presented a wireframe to get approval to start building. Adjust design and functionality to fit the client's fickle preferences. As a project lead, it was primarily my job to interact with the clients, delegate the responsibilities for each member as well as make executive decisions when we couldn't agree how to proceed.

#     Stack Overflow clone project introduced the complexity of nested custom built routes. It's easy to get confused in an insane amount of controllers spread accross multiple folders. Especially on a team, when people are always making changes and adding new code. But I learned to appreciate RESTular naming conventions as well as overcome my fear of merging conflicts. Myself and another teammate decided to revive this project, improve styling, functionality and iron out a few bugs.

#     This is my very first programming project. Before this, I spent few weeks looking at videos, trying to code along. I realized I learn by doing, rather than repeating what others do in a video, so I started this project to explore vanilla javaScript. This is in no way close to finish. At the time I didn't know about making code DRY or Object Oriented Programming. So there is a lot of refactoring that needs to be done. I'd also like to confess that all the images were made by yours truly, with the help of good old MS paint.

#     This simple project aimed to give me a better understanding of jQuery. It was a part of an online course I took on <a href='udemy.com'>udemy</a> that got me interested in programming in the first place. It was also a good way to practice form submission error messages managed by javaScript, and explore different ways they could be accomplished.

#     I made this before I knew of various CSS styling libraries. It could look better, but I think learning to do CSS helped me understand web design much better. I'm comfortable with facing styling challenges that materialize or bootstrap doesn't have an answer for. I also learned to appreciate what these libraries do for me, especially in terms of positioning. Floats are notorious for being difficult to work with and grid system these libraries are offering are invaluable.

#     This project is mostly focused on learning/practicing react. React seems to be a very popular framework for front-end web development. I also was mind blown with how fast changes take place and the simplicity with which items can be rerendered with simple change of state (before this it could be quite a pain to try and append appropriate elements in appropriate places after an ajax call). So far the hardest part was to configure my environment with node, npm and nvm.

#     I learned of jekyll from a mentor at Dev Bootcamp, and based on her enthusiasm for the framework decided to try it. While building this site I've was able to pick up a lot of cool concepts as well as learn some new technologies, such as making bash scripts, using sass, as well as building, maintaining and troubleshouting a live site with attention to user experience, generating content and desighning layout. I extracted a lot of hardcoded data so that this site can be easily cloned/forked on github and adopted to be used by someone else.
