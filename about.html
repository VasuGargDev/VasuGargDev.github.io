        Hi, my name is Vasu Garg. I'm a programmer and have a passion for building things. Solving day to day problems by building things out of waste materials has been a hobby of mine. My first introduction to programming was in the 10th standard with a mandatory cource on python. At first, I was skeptical but soon discovered the joy of computing and also realized how useful these skills can be to showcase my best out of waste creations to the world. Since then I've learned various languages and frameworks and built more to-do lists then I can count. It's always gratifying to learn together in groups and help each other as well as partaking in a rabbit hole with fellow students because everyone comes up with unique questions and unique approaches to solve them.

        A huge motivation behind building this portfolio website was to be able to showcase my projects, so feel free to browse the <a class="about_me_links" href="/projects">projects</a> section to check out what I've built, <a class="about_me_links" href="/contact">shoot me an email</a> or connect on <a class="about_me_links" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vasugargacm/">linkedIn</a>.
